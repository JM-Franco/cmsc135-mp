# Snake

Snake is a very popular arcade game which was invented during the mid 1970s. For this semester, the general objective is to develop the snake game through Assembly as an exhibition of your skill in this particular brand of programming. To those who are not familiar with the game, kindly watch visit this link:

The game has four important components, namely the snake, board, score, and food. Here are the following specific objectives of the project:

1. The dimension of the board is entirely up to you.
2. The starting length of the snake is three (3) characters/blocks.
3. The starting score will obviously be zero (0).
4. The snake increases its size by one character/block after consuming a food.
5. The score increases by one after the snake consumes a food.
6. The user should be able to control theÂ snake using both W-A-S-D control and arrow keys control.
7. The game stops when the snake hits the board or itself.
8. Design is entirely up to you. However, please make sure that the snake, food, and board have different colors.
